## Description

In this project, I developed a CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) of medieval items, in the format of an API, using Typescript and Express.

## After downloading the project:

create an .env file to connect to your local MySQL database:
```
MYSQL_USER=yourUser
MYSQL_PASSWORD=yourPass
MYSQL_HOST=yourHost
JWT_SECRET=yourSecretPass
PORT=3000
```
Then:

```
npm i
npm start
```
